# THDeggendorf AI Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The core mission of THDeggendorf AI is to be inclusive to the widest range of students, from varying backgrounds and fields of study. We firmly commit to fostering a welcoming, safe, and positive environment for all, irrespective of gender, sexual orientation, capability, ethnicity, financial status, and religious beliefs or lack thereof.

This code of conduct delineates our expectations from all who associate themselves with our organization, and the consequences that follow unacceptable behavior.

We encourage everyone involved with THDeggendorf AI to help us cultivate a nurturing and positive environment for all members.

## 2. Promotion of Technological Citizenship

One of the ancillary objectives of this Code of Conduct is to bolster technological citizenship. This is achieved by encouraging students to identify and fortify the connection between their actions and their impact on the broader community.

Educational institutions are a reflection of the broader society. Hence, proactive measures are essential to negate prevalent prejudices and misuse of power.

If you observe someone going above and beyond to ensure our organization is inclusive, friendly, and stimulates all members to contribute wholly, we encourage you to share this.

## 3. Expected Behavior

All members of the organization are anticipated to:

 * Engage genuinely and actively, thus adding to the vitality and longevity of our community.
 * Display consideration and respect in both speech and actions.
 * Endeavor for collaboration over confrontation.
 * Avoid speech and behavior that's degrading, discriminatory, or harassing.
 * Be vigilant of your surroundings and fellow members. Promptly notify the organizational moderators of any unsafe situations or violations of this Code of Conduct.
 * Remember that our campus venues might be accessible to others; hence, courtesy should be extended to all.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

Within our organization, the following behaviors will be considered as harassment and are unacceptable:

 * Violence or threats of violence directed towards another individual.
 * Any form of discriminatory jokes or language based on gender, race, sexuality, etc.
 * Display or posting of violent or sexually explicit material.
 * Unauthorized disclosure or threats to disclose personal information.
 * Personal slights, especially those based on gender, sexuality, race, religion, or disability.
 * Unauthorized recording or photography.
 * Unwanted physical contact or any form of unwanted sexual attention.
 * Intentional intimidation, online stalking or following.
 * Endorsement or encouragement of any of the above behaviors.
 * Continuous disturbance during organizational events or presentations.

## 5. Policy on Dangerous Items

Dangerous items, including weapons, are strictly prohibited at THDeggendorf AI events or meetings. This includes items like guns, large knives, explosives, and any other object that can be used to inflict harm. Possession of such items will lead to immediate expulsion from the event or venue.

## 6. Repercussions of Unacceptable Behavior

Indulgence in unacceptable behavior by any member, including those in authoritative positions, will not be tolerated.

Individuals who are requested to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to do so may result in actions deemed suitable by the organizational moderators, ranging from temporary suspension to permanent exclusion.

## 7. Reporting Protocol

Should you become of, or witness to, unacceptable behavior, or if you have any concerns, please approach an organizational moderator at the earliest.
